# Google Searches Indicate Financial Crime in Countries

This repository provides the code for the report [Google Searches Indicate Financial Crime in Countries](Google%20Searches%20Indicate%20Financial%20Crime%20in%20Countries.pdf).

## Abstract

A theory of amplification of public interest by financial crime in countries and the crucial role of internet
search in todayâ€™s information gathering process, as well as perceived online anonymity, suggest
the use of online interest measured by internet search volumes as indicator of financial crime in
countries. This report finds significant correlation between Google search volumes for _money laundering_
and _corruption_ in countries and corresponding indicators. Thus, Google search volumes are
proposed as complementary source for country risk assessments in financial crime prevention with
specified limitations.
